# forgetfulForest
A generator and interactive page for "Forest of Forgetfulness" logic puzzles, based on ones found in "What is the Name of this Book?" by Raymond Smullyan.

A live example can be found [here](https://dmackinnon1.github.io/forgetfulForest/).

## Building the Puzzles
The puzzles are built by running the forest.py script in the build directory. This generates a json file in the data directory that contains the puzzle descriptions.
